Books Table: Includes book_id, title, author, isbn, and available_copies.
Transactions Table: Includes transaction_id, user_id, book_id, action, and date.
Establish relationships between:
Users and Roles via role_id.
Transactions with Users and Books.
Login and Registration (4 points)
Registration: Allow new users to register with details such as username, password, email, and role.
Login: Enable users to log in with proper authentication 
Authorization: Implement role-based access control for user and administrator functionalities.
